## **1. Introduction**

![Serenity Logo](images/logo.png)

Welcome to the User Guide of **Serenity**!

Are you a tutor teaching CS2101 in NUS? Do you struggle to keep track of students' attendance and class participation
on many different excel sheets for different lessons? Do you also tend to forget to address questions students asked
during lessons? Fret not, our application, **Serenity**, will help keep you sane when managing tutorial groups.

**Serenity** is a desktop application that helps CS2101 tutors manage their lessons. This application is optimized
for use through a <i>Command Line Interface (CLI)</i>, meaning that you operate the application by typing commands into a
command box. This application also has a <i>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</i>, 
where you can interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.

This user guide serves to provide you with an in-depth documentation on how to set up and use our application.
With that said, let's get [started](#2-quick-start)!

* The XLSX file should store a list of students.
* The list of students you are importing cannot exist in another tutorial group.
* The format of the XLSX file should be the same as the XLSX file that you may download from LUMINUS. 
Examples of valid and invalid file formats can be found in the [XLSX file format documentaion](/XlsxFileFormat.md)
* To obtain the PATH_TO_XLSX, either:<br>
