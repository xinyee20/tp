<H2 style="color: #477B9F"> 1. Introduction </H2>

Welcome to the User Guide of **Serenity**!

Are you a tutor teaching CS2101 in NUS? Do you struggle to keep track of students' attendance and class participation
on many different excel sheets for different lessons? Do you also tend to forget to address questions students asked
during lessons? Fret not, our application, **Serenity**, will help keep you sane when managing tutorial groups.

**Serenity** is a desktop application that helps CS2101 tutors manage their lessons. This application is optimized
for use through a _Command Line Interface (CLI)_, meaning that you operate the application by typing commands into a
command box. This application also has a _Graphical User Interface (GUI)_, where you can interact with the application
through graphical icons such as buttons.

This user guide serves to provide you with an in-depth documentation on how to set up and use our application.
With that said, let's get [started](#2-quick-start)!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<H2 style="color: #477B9F"> 2. Quick start </H2>

To get started with using **Serenity**, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `Serenity.jar` from [here]().

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your **Serenity** application.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The _GUI_ similar to the image below should appear in a few seconds.

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the _Command Box_ and press `Enter` to execute it.
