### Project: Serenity

Serenity is a desktop application that helps CS2101 tutors manage their tutorial groups and lessons. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
It is written in Java, and has about 25k LoC.

#### Summary of contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature 1**: Implementation of `QuestionManager`
  * What it does: It manages and track all the questions asked during lessons
  * Justification: This enhancement improves the architecture of the model component, and the 
    storing of the question data for each lesson. It abstracts out the implementation of methods 
    related to questions from the `ModelManager` to the `QuestionManager` and lessen deep nesting 
    of data from tutorial group to tutorial lesson to list of questions.
  * Highlights: This enhancement requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, the Model,
    Logic and Ui components. The implementation was challenging as we decided to refactor our original 
    model design of storing the list of questions in the middle of v1.2 which affected a lot of files.

* **New Feature 2**: Added the ability to add, delete, edit and find questions through commands
  * What it does: Allows user to use the addressing question feature
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it is helps a user to 
    keep track of the questions asked during tutorial lessons.
  * Highlights: This enhancement requires an in-depth analysis of the model design alternatives. The 
    implementation too was challenging especially for the find command, as I decided that the keywords 
    inputted by users does not need to match the full word in a sentence for the question to be displayed.
    
* **New Feature 3**: Added the ability to view all questions and view a lesson's details 
  * What it does: Allows user to switch between views in Serenity
  * Justification: This enhancement improves the product significantly because a user will want to
    be able to switch to different views in Serenity efficiently though typing of commands.

  * Highlights: This enhancement required the in-depth analysis of the UI and Logic component. 
    The implementation was also challenging as it involved using JavaFX which is a relatively new 
    framework that I needed to pick up quickly. I was not able to see through the implementation for 
    the Ui component due to time constraint, thus I handed it over to my other team member to work on it.

* **New Feature 4**: Added the ability to load and save the questions into a json file 
  * What it does: Stores the questions in the application as a json file when a user exits the application.
  * Justification: This enhancement improves the product significantly because a user will want to
    be able to see the questions added previously when he/she relaunches the application.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required the in-depth analysis of the Storage and Model component. I had 
    to learn and implement the conversion of Jackson-friendly version of objects to store in json file. I 
    also implemented the loading and saving of the data when the user launches or closes the application.

* **Project management**:
  * Used Github Issues Tracker to schedule, track and assign tasks to teammates.
  * Facilitated weekly team meetings about implementation details, deliverables, and deadlines.
  * Compiled the minutes during team meetings and consultations for future referencing. 
  * Brainstormed ideas for the different features and design considerations.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Repackage and cleaned up code.
